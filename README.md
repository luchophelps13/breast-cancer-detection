# breast-cancer-detection

### Huge thanks to the Youtuber Computer Science (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbmb5IoBtHZTpYZCDBOC1CA), for the help with this project. 
# This program uses machine learning to classify to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant.

#### The algorithm I used was the Random Forest Algorithm, with ~96% accuracy. Random Forests, which can be used for classification and regression, is a collection of decision trees, however, the RF does not get overfit to data, due to the number of trees, and the fact they each run on different parameters of the data.
